<h1>Yuumi Bot</h1>

<b>
  Yuumi bot is a bot that plays League of Legends.  Running player.py will instantiate a Yuumi object, which creates a server.  Yuumi's duo partner should run client.py so that they can send commands to Yuumi to aid her in skill shots, as well as warding and using item actives.
